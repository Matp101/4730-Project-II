# 4730-Project-II

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Form a group of 3 or 4 students. Select a Kaggle.com competition either in vision or NLP, and make a research data analysis project using deep learning approaches. You should use your own initiative to define one or several research questions and use the resources available, based on the Python libraries (in particular Pytorch or Keras), to apply different deep learning approaches to this data to predict accurately the class of the unlabeled data and to answer your research questions. You should try to build a model as performant as possible for the selected task(s). You need to evaluate your model accuracy compared to other existing models. You need to evaluate how each properties/characteristic of your model affect the overall accuracy. \
You have to write a paper (minimum 8 pages, maximum 10 pages) about your project similar to a research paper for a publication. This implies a state of art, a presentation of the research questions and the chosen methods to tackle them, a presentation of the results and discussion and a conclusion/future work. You will have to provide the Python codes you developed for this project.

## Deliverables

- [x] Select a competition in either vision or NLP
  - [ ] A safe NLP go-to might be the [spooky author identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification/data) competition, since the dataset is reasonably small and easy to run
  - [x] Another NLP one we could try does [sentiment analysis on rotten tomatoes reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)
  - [ ] A good image option might be the [CIFAR-10](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cifar-10) dataset, which does appear as a competition from 8 years ago. It gives a pretty classic identification problem, which should be easy to solve, and will allow us to compare different learning approaches
- [ ] We will be using keras since we are more familiar with it, and we can more easily use GPU libraries
- [ ] must be performant and accurate
